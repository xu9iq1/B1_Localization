    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990477.Content": "That move was simply a mistake!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990478.Content": "A minor trick. Wukong could make them by the hundreds!",

    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990486.Content": "Worthless servant! I'll let you off the hook today, but don't let it go to your head!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990487.Content": "He has wings as hard as steel. Land your strike only when he spreads them!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990488.Content": "I'll rip those wings right off you! Just you wait!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990489.Content": "You cur! No more blocking!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990490.Content": "That's even tougher than the skull of a monkey!",

    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990499.Content": "Now your head's tougher than its horn!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990500.Content": "A hard skull, indeed!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990501.Content": "Not so great and mighty now, are we?",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990502.Content": "A poor death, by a mere untamed animal.",

    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990505.Content": "Vile beast! Here comes your death!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990507.Content": "What's with this coagulation of blood? Foul, it is!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990508.Content": "Spin your staff, kid!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990509.Content": "Even I have never seen such monstrosity.",

    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990511.Content": "Did you tick off our friend in there, kid?",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990512.Content": "Quick, pull out whatever you have. My life is on the line!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990513.Content": "What's that sound? Can you handle it or not, kid?",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990514.Content": "Has... has it gotten desperate or what?",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990515.Content": "Ouch! That was a serious strike, right in the gut! Awww...",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990516.Content": "Ungrateful wretch! I've been nothing but good to you, and this is how you repay me?",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990517.Content": "Ow! Watch your aim, kid, make sure you're not hitting me!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990518.Content": "Hey! It hurts! Hurry up and finish it off!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990519.Content": "Please! Stop stabbing me... Please, no more!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990520.Content": "Do something, kid, or I'll be dead sooner than you think!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990521.Content": "Make it stop, will you, kid?",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990522.Content": "Who just fell? You or the mantis?",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990523.Content": "Is it down for the count? Now finish it off!",
    "FUStDialogueDesc.350990524.Content": "Why are you failing me now of all times, kid? Now I'm done for!",

As their situation grew dire, the young man took on any work to make ends meet. The villagers praised him for caring for his mother, deeming him a dutiful son.\r\n\r\nIn an unlucky year of crop failure, the mother and son set out to seek refuge with relatives. Along the way, a gang of bandits emerged. Eyes fierce, faces scarred, they brandished their blades, demanding nothing but gold. The mother and son, destitute, resorted to begging for mercy. But the bandits showed no mercy and were intent on killing them. The young man, believing their death was imminent, seized a bandit's knife; with a resolute heart, he ended his own mother's life and pledged himself to the bandits. And so, he joined their ranks. News of the incident spread, and people condemned him as a coward, truly a cursed son.\r\n\r\nYears passed. One day, the entire gang of bandits was wiped out, leaving no trace. Some said a hero had come to rid the land of evil and uphold justice. Others claimed a guai had emerged in the mountains, bringing a long-delayed reckoning. Debates raged on, but eventually, the topic faded from memory. One day, a man, covered in blood, stumbled down from the mountains, recounting an encounter with a towering bandit, neither human nor guai, wielding a massive blade to rob the roads.

It seemed his years of training went against the ways of the world.\r\n\r\nOne day, as he passed through the New West, he heard tales of a dharma of ecstasy in that place that could free a troubled mind. He sought an audience with the abbot.\r\n\r\nThe abbot was a chubby monk in yellow robes who loved to transform. He heard out the wolf guai's woes and counselled, \"Wolves are born to hunt, to slay. It is the way of your kind. Men are not the same; they are born to plough and plant, to reap and sow. Frail and feeble, such is their lot. They seek to leash you wolves with false pre-empts, for they hope to escape your fangs and claws. But heed me, wolf: each kind must follow the call of their blood, the song of their soul. Why should you bow to the mewling of men?\"\r\n\r\nThese words lit up the wolf guai's mind. At that moment, he knew his path lay within the halls of New Thunderclap Temple, where he would walk the road to ecstasy. The chubby monk laughed, \"In my temple, we bow to none save our own hearts.

It was the dreaded rhythm of the ginseng harvesters' mountain shoes, crushing the thick layers of decaying leaves and rocky earth. And with every eerie resonance, the siblings of the ginseng plants vanished, disappearing one by one. Only the tiniest survivors managed to evade this grim fate, their diminutive size providing a fleeting reprieve.

With the years that had passed, it was likely the offspring of harvesters who were generations younger than those who came before; then a quickened pace, a sense of anticipation-the crimson threads had surely been spotted. But oh, what ill fortune! As the ginseng harvester reached for the thread, it led him to a grim sight-the entwined remains of a skeleton.

Eager to learn, the young wolf shared the wine with Bullguard and seized the opportunity to inquire about secret techniques. Partaken in the wine, feeling compelled, Bullguard taught him a few tricks. Rejoicing, the young wolf hurried home to practice.\r\n\r\nTwo months passed, and having found little benefit in those teachings, he contemplated giving up. Recalling his previous success in bartering wine for knowledge, he retrieved a small golden statue and approached the Snake Patroller. Persuaded by gold, the greedy creature shared some techniques with him. Back at home, the young wolf practiced as instructed. Another month passed, yet his gains remained minimal. Undeterred, he repeated his tactics with other guais, exchanging valuables for teachings.\r\n\r\nOver time, he visited everyone in the mountain, amassing a repertoire of techniques.

There, veiled behind curtains, a sacred effigy stood, its origins unknown, the altar laden with delectable offerings and fine spirits. As advised, he nestled himself between the curtains, indulging in the liquor until his belches betrayed him to the gathering crowd in the shrine.\r\n\r\nTrapped between the curtains, the wolf guai listened as a voice rang out, \"The wine jar I offered is empty.

Among them was a youngster, who commented on the bolus intoxicated. \"How generous our King is,\" he remarked, \"Far better than that Lingxuzi, who was good at making pills but never shared them with his underlings. What a tightwad!\" The youngster's words cast a shadow across the old wolf's face, and he silently took his leave. \"He had roamed the mountain with Lingxuzi long before our King's reign. Yet, you judged his deceased former master in front of him. Loyal as he is, you are in trouble now!\" warned an elder guai. However, the young guai shrugged off his warning.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the old wolf returned the golden pill to the King, citing its value too high to possess by an archer. Hearing the news, the other yaoguais urged the young one to apologize and seek forgiveness, but he remained defiant. Within a few days, while venturing outside, the youngster was killed by several arrows, each piercing his heart. Many said that even the golden pill couldn't save the youngster from his fate.",

Seeing this, the big frog chided him for not speaking up in his defense and even began to suspect his smaller companion.\r\n\r\nHesitated for a while, the small frog then admitted to breaking the glass.

Hence, rat guais from across the land flocked to the kingdom. Although strife ensued between commoners and guais, none dared defy the king's decree. For the well-being of people, the scholars of the Royal Academy planned a petition to implore the segregation of rat guais to the southwest corner of the capital.\r\n\r\nAmong these scholars, there was an elder who was deeply skilled in divination. On the day of the petition, right before the scholars were to meet the king, the elder divined for his career, which came out as a grave omen. \"Not an auspicious time for it,\" he told his students the omen in secret, \"I advise you to take sick leave with me today\". However, his students, faithful and young, heeded him not and went forth gallantly.\r\n\r\nJust as the elder stepped outside the palace, the Royal Guards encircled the hall. Shouts of agony then filled the air, unfolding the bloodshed within. Hands covering his trembling ears, the elder slowly made his way home. After three kingless assemblies and a major court reshuffle, he was promoted to Grand Governor, a rank that bestowed him years of wealth and glory. But one day, as he peered into a bronze mirror, he noticed that his nose was elongated, and bristles had sprouted on both sides. Henceforth, he forsook mirrors, knowing he would always bear a rat's visage like all those absented from that petition.",

Among the market stands, an Everlife Shop stood as the sole purveyor of coffins.\r\n\r\nOn that fateful day, the shopkeeper idled inside when a man of lumbering gait entered, garbed like a beggar. As the shopkeeper rose to shoo him away, the man spoke, \"Hold, sir. I've come not to beg but to buy coffins.\" With quiet words, he told of his village laid to ruin by bandits and his need for four coffins to lay the dead to rest. Suspicious but intrigued, the shopkeeper agreed to a trade in their native herbs, Suoyang and Congrong.\r\n\r\nThe shopkeeper gathered his lads and followed the man, with four coffins on an oxcart. Laboring through sand and wind, they reached the village at dusk. Here, the man muttered, \"'All life ends and returns to earth.' These winds can do harm, and if our bodies are not properly buried, our souls might be twisted. Please, sir, bury my family with these coffins. We had Suoyang and Congrong in our hearth. Take as much as you like.\" And with that, he vanished.\r\n\r\nEntering the village, the shopkeeper found all living things slaughtered, not a soul left alive.

His mother's scolding and punishments were frequent, forcing him to commit to the martial arts. He did try hard, yet his efforts only left him feeble and trembling. The same skill that took only a few days to acquire for his peers could take him weeks with no noticeable progress. Even the Prince urged him to explore a different path, therefore the boy's enthusiasm for martial waned further.\r\n\r\nAs his brothers donned red armor and golden shields, he stood alone, enduring more beatings and scorn. Once, his mother went too far with her harsh words, \"Better to be eaten by the tiger than remain useless at home,\" which drove him to steal his father's shield and spear to fulfill his mother's wish. The Tiger Vanguard knocked him down in two moves, mouth opened for a gulp.\r\n\r\nBut stones were hurled, striking the tiger in his head. Startled, the Tiger Vanguard gazed around for the culprit. Some of the rats seized the moment, dragging away their kin from the tiger's grip. The Vanguard turned to chase, but there stood the rat soldiers, those who had never ventured from the dunes, now spears pointed, shields hoisted-a line of defiance so fierce, they dared the tiger to challenge them. The tiger hesitated, and the rats left safely.\r\n\r\nThat boy did later forsake the warrior's way, but he took up his bow alongside the rat archers.

Renowned for its ability to reform wayward youths from fallen households, the temple was spoken highly of for guiding lost souls toward righteous paths. This tale, as told by a landowner, is about one such disciple, Zhao San.\r\n\r\nZhao San was a vagabond. He beguiled guests of brothels into lavish spending, and one of his patrons turned out to be Landowner Wang's son. He soon found himself pursued by the authorities and facing a trial against Wang. A Daoist from the Fumefire Temple happened upon him and offered sanctuary.\r\n\r\nFrom that point forward, Zhao San immersed himself in the pursuit of wisdom, practiced diligently, and dutifully undertook tasks assigned by his master. One day, when he descended the mountain on an errand, he came across Meiniang, a concubine being mistreated by the wife of a household during their journey to the temple. Without hesitation, Zhao San intervened, rescued Meiniang, and brought her to the temple to shield her from the cruelty of that family.\r\n\r\nWith nowhere else to turn, Meiniang was welcomed into the temple by the master and became a disciple. Filled with gratitude for Zhao San saving her life, she tended to the temple's chores. Over time, she repeatedly sought to become Zhao San's spiritual partner, yet her advances were always rebuffed.\r\n\r\nYears later, having made significant spiritual progress, Zhao San underwent an ascension ceremony organized by his master, with Meiniang invited as a witness.

Filled with a longing to practice alongside him, Meiniang followed suit amidst cheers and blessings.\r\n\r\nAs the smoke rose, they were reborn from the blazing flames as the eternal guardians of the river of lava.

One day, the disciple accompanied his master for some liquor in town, and they came across a fugitive being pursued by officers. As the temple was short on help, and the fugitive was a wealthy one, they offered him shelter. This man, Zhao San, was a mere wastrel who lured patrons of brothels into extravagant spending. The temple was already home to various robbers and bandits, and it proved to be a corrupting influence on Zhao San. In the company of fellow criminals every day, he soon became ten times more villainous than before.\r\n\r\nOne day, Zhao San set off to rob travelers to fund his own lavish lifestyle. He targeted a wealthy family returning from their monthly worship, and in an act driven by greed and lust, he abducted the family's concubine, Meiniang.\r\n\r\nImprisoned within the temple walls, Meiniang endured daily chores and beatings.

Thus, the Bull Sergeant always schemed to influence the tributes towards his own preferences. One day, leaning on the doorframe and sighing deeply, he noticed the smoke from his nose resembled his beloved chicken and devised a plan.\r\n\r\nHe told all the tribute bearers that the shape of the smoke rising from Flaming Mountains at dusk indicated what the Plantain Fan desired as offerings. Believing this to be a divine sign, the people, despite their hardships, started contributing exactly as the smoke suggested. The Bull Sergeant received many of his desired items and reveled in a contented life. However, over time, this led to growing discontent among the villagers toward Rakshasi and her rains.\r\n\r\nOne day, Lady Rakshasi had to leave for a lecture by Lord Lao in the Celestial Court and was unable to bring rain for the people.

Its sought-after properties for enhancing both yin and yang energies attracted many pill crafters. Yet, this rare substance of the mountain spirits remains elusive and priceless.\r\n\r\nThen there was Cheng Ming, a man obsessed with oddities, scorned by his family for his poverty. Learning that Flame Ores were formed within Flamlings, he set out to profit from it. Selling all he had, he plunged into the mountains, fixated on capturing a Flamling.\r\n\r\nDays turned to weeks with no news, save that his makeshift shelter mysteriously burned down. Raging at his misfortune, he saw a large red worm emerge from the ground before him-half-buried, half-exposed, with the innocent face of a child, much like a disciple of Guanyin's. Startled by Cheng Ming's fury, it wept. Cheng Ming shouted to scare and silence it, but it only angered the Flamling, who swiftly burrowed away.\r\n\r\nIt was only then that Cheng Ming realized it was a Flamling. He leaped about, hoping to lure it out again. Finally, the guai, annoyed perhaps, burrowed out and struck him with a fireball. The clothes and skin of Cheng Ming caught on fire, and he rolled on the ground in pain and despair.\r\n\r\nHe broke down in tears, realizing that he couldn't seize the Flame Ore by himself. Then, amused and curious, the Flamling drew near him. For this one time, Cheng Ming chose to be brutal and resolute; he smashed its head with a rock until it was completely shattered.\r\n\r\nCheng Ming continued this merciless act and harvested plenty of Flame Ores, but he kept his methods a secret. His growing sales of the ores eventually earned him fame as a renowned medicine gatherer far and wide.",

With their daily duties to maintain the flow of the underworld, being sent to the mortal realm was akin to the days of rest-a break from their relentless toil.\r\n\r\nOne day, as they patrolled Flaming Mountains, four stalwarts shared their stories. One pointed to Furnace Valley and remarked, \"This lava here makes me think of my task back underground. Those who committed arson in life are sentenced to embrace searing-hot copper pillars naked in our Copper Depth. We had to fuel the fire and scrape off burnt flesh once and again. If we had a Firefall like it here, it would surely make things easier.\"\r\n\r\nAnother added, \"True. And those who broke families in life go to our Iron Depth. We plant an edge of the blade tree into their back and hang them on the tree. Our endless days are spent sharpening the blades and trimming the trees. Sometimes, the blade cuts through their flesh and they fall with wounds wide open. That's when we stitch them up, carry them from the ground, and hang them on the blade again. A giant iron ball like the one ahead would make the job much simpler.\"\r\n\r\nThe third one chimed in, \"You have it easy. Those who torture animals go to our Bull Depth. There, they are trampled and gored by lavabulls. We must tend the bulls, fit them with iron hooves, and sharpen their horns. The crushed corpses must be dug out occasionally, lest they clog the path of the bulls.

One morning, he found the guest room had been tidily arranged overnight: dustless furniture, washed fruits on plates, and freshly brewed tea. Perplexed, he thought of the furry celestial maidens serving the Lady and the fox maidens attending the King's daughter. Recalling how the other guards often teased him for being more handsome than the rest, now, as a new captain, he couldn't help but feel elated-surely, there must be a secret admirer.\r\n\r\nFor over a month, this mysterious \"kind-hearted maiden\" visited nightly yet never revealed herself. Growing impatient, the captain resolved to wait outside the chamber one night. Around the fourth watch, he heard heavy steps, quite unlike the gentle maidens, furred or fox. Regardless, he lunged at the figure as soon as the door opened and secured a tight hold on it. The figure was muscular and sturdy, too large for his arms. Muffled grunts followed, and the voice of the Bull Sergeant emerged, \"I like things tidy, and your room is always messy. That's why I'd clean it up after my night duty. You don't have to act so... grateful...\"",

As one raised his flaming blade to strike, the desperate soul pleaded, \"Spare me, kind sirs. Should I revive, I'll burn ten houses of paper ingots in your honor.\" The other charface restrained his companion and proposed, \"Let's have a wager then. If you win, you go free. But if you lose, blame your own luck.\" The soul asked, \"What would be the wager?\" And he answered: \"If half the souls entering the city today wish to return to life like you, you win.\" With that, he handed over paper and ink and tasked the soul with recording the names and earthly obsessions of those newly deceased.\r\n\r\nAs the gate closed for the day, the soul hurried to the charfaces and declared, \"I've won! I've won indeed!\" The charfaces presented the list to the Gatemaster, who found that it matched perfectly in both numbers and names and even included details the deceased themselves hadn't revealed. Satisfied, the Gatemaster held the soul in high regard, generously rewarded him, and said, \"I know you seek to leave the city, but the gates are shut for today. Perhaps you should come again tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nMonths passed with the soul returning daily, and each day a similar bet was made. Over time, the soul ceased longing for a return to life and took up a role as a scribe under the Gatemaster.\r\n\r\nAlas, it makes one wonder: should we look ahead and accept whatever future awaits us, or stay committed to steadfast goals? Perhaps there's no right answer. What matters is the willingness to make your choice.",

Why would I risk this practice because of you?\" She left swiftly, but after many tearful pleas by the river, the boy was forgiven. However, within half a year, he broached her with the proposal again, persisting in his deluded fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe woman, after pondering, said, \"How can you speak of the practice of yin and yang with me before you see my true form? Follow me, and you shall see.\"\r\n\r\nShe led him deep into the woods and revealed a massive, gnarled cypress tree. She glided onto its canopy and disappeared.

It was a place where peddlers exchanged goods while waiting for the gate to open, but due to the prices, even the townsfolk began to participate. Thus, this market gradually gained its reputation.\r\n\r\nA few months ago, an odd oil peddler arrived at the market. Garbed in robes of a pearly turquoise color and with eyes that gleamed like copper bells. He had a voice that rang out with a boom, and his breath was foul and pungent. Yet, he happened to be a keen talker and naturally was disliked by everyone. The oil he produces, on the other hand, was sought after by everyone. Who would not prefer the oil clear and smooth, and not to mention its price: one could exchange but a pinch of fragrant powder for a large gourd of such oil.\r\n\r\nOne day, a wandering Daoist passed through the town and decided to visit the market. He enjoyed his experience until he sensed an eerie green mist emanating from that old peddler-a guai, no doubt. The monk chanted, and before the peddler could manage a decent struggle, it revealed its true form-a green-skinned giant frog.\r\n\r\nThe bystanders were startled and grabbed whatever they could use to attack. The frog kicked the ground with both legs, leaped higher than a tree, and swiftly fled toward the mountains. In pursuit, the folks arrived at the marshes, where they witnessed countless small frogs scraping mucus from each other's bodies, collecting it in a large barrel. They then applied fragrant powder to themselves, hugging and sniffing each other in sheer delight.\r\n\r\nSilently, the people approached and peered into the barrel. The mucus inside gleamed with clarity, just like the oil they had favored. At the sight, they were occupied by bouts of nausea and began to vomit. None had the strength to pursue and kill guais.

Upon his return to the Kingdom of Zhuzi, numerous weavers approached him, hoping he would lead them to the Estate of Zhu on the ridge to find the legendary jade shuttle.\r\n\r\nThe young man, overwhelmed, shut his doors to visitors, but his mother couldn't understand his reluctance and pressured him to lead the weavers to the ridge to slay the yaoguais and rescue his father. Yet, human nature is unpredictable, and the weavers, each with their own agendas, failed to unite in the face of danger. They quarreled incessantly and were ultimately wiped out by a giant green spider in the Estate. The young man, cowering in fear, was shocked to see the spider transform into the green-clad maiden he had once encountered in the cave. Disillusioned with humanity, he tearfully begged the fairy to let him stay on the ridge and cultivate. The green-clad maiden scolded him harshly and expelled him from the Estate.\r\n\r\nThe young man wandered to an abandoned village on the ridge. The insect guais, having heard of his plight, took pity on him. A dragonfly guai introduced him to her master, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, at the Temple of Yellow Flowers.\r\n\r\nAt the temple, all the Daoists wore stone masks. The Daoist Master told the young man that to achieve the Dao, he must sever all worldly ties and don a stone mask to cut off his mortal connections. The young man hesitated and wandered around the temple. Unexpectedly, an elderly woman in red arrived with a group of beautiful maidens, including the green-clad maiden and the girl in yellow.\r\n\r\nLater, the temple hosted a banquet for the maidens. The young man, spying from the side, saw the table laden with dishes: human oil stir-fried, fresh human meat cooked and roasted, tofu blocks made from human brains, and meat buns filled with human flesh. The stench was nauseating, and he could only watch as the yaoguais feasted on humans. The Daoist Master, noticing his shock, remarked indifferently, \"It is in a yaoguai's nature to eat humans. Mortal lives are short; even if we consume them, it only shortens their lifespan by a few decades, a mere blink of an eye.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, the young man felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness. Under the moonlight, he played a tune from his homeland, feeling utterly lost. He realized that if he didn't become a yaoguai, he might be eaten by his fellow disciples. Reflecting deeply, he questioned how he had ended up in such a predicament. After a long night of tears, he resolved to become a disciple and pursue the Dao. Since he couldn't change his fate, he decided go with it. Determined, he asked his master for the quickest path to becoming a yaoguai. The master told him, \"In the Purple Cloud Mountain, there is a rare insect called the Amourworm. Consuming its eggs will allow you to ascend and become a yaoguai...\"",

I've heard of your fame as a medicine gatherer, and I can offer a partnership.\"\r\n\r\nCheng Ming asked, \"What is this Mother of Flamlings?\" and the immortalist answered, \"It is ten times larger than a typical Flamling, and could fetch a fortune in gold.\" The catch is the need for a substantial amount of Flame Ores as bait.\r\n\r\nInitially, Cheng Ming declined because it cost him his precious Flame Ores, but the immortalist returned with a load of the ores, and beseeched him, \"I have an urgent need for Gold Flame Ore. Find the Mother of Flamlings with these baits I've given you, and if you catch it, you shall receive the gold I promised.\"\r\n\r\nCheng Ming accepted such a lucrative offer in an instant, and the two set off on the following day.\r\n\r\nDuring their journey, the immortalist realized Cheng Ming lacked any power and used mere street tricks to deceive the Flame guais. However, as a true man who did not fuss over minor quibbles, he accepted Cheng Ming's methods, and together, they located the Flamlings' lair.\r\n\r\nThere, the immortalist lured out the enormous Mother of Flamlings using copious amounts of Flame Ores. Confronted by the Mother, they were bombarded with fireballs and overwhelmed. Cheng Ming had no power to resist and was nearly burned to death.

Cheng Ming harvested the Gold Flame Ore from the Mother, and the Flame Ores from the Flamlings, alongside the bait brought by the immortalist. He returned with a fortune and wrote books like \"Mountain Chronicles\" and \"Observations of Fire\", boasting of his solo conquest of the Mother of Flamlings.\r\n\r\nIf you wonder why Cheng Ming turned to writing instead of continuing his life gathering Flame Ores, a line in his book hints at the answer: \"With the Mother's demise, her children scattered, and no Flamlings will appear here for five hundred years.\"",

Armed with twin hammers that summoned forth the fury of thunder, the prince could smite those before him, leaving nothing but dust.\r\n\r\nLong ages passed, yet still, there were those who sought the pearl. Among the people, it was whispered that when the River Ji burst its banks and the waters rose in wrathful flood, it was surely the doing of the loong prince, his wrath roused by the trespasses of those who sought his treasure.

With a single swift dive, he set his course for the loong's palace.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, he found the palace strangely silent and empty, with no sign of the soldiers he had expected.

Think you that I am some petty yaoguai, to wreak havoc at my own whim? No, I would not dare to call forth the smallest storm save at the bidding of those higher. Idle talk, all of it! My own sire was condemned to the bite of steel for one trifling error. We loongs, though our hearts are true as any, are treated with such injustice...\"\r\n\r\nThe young man said, \"I have heard of the Loong King's plight. A grievous injustice, indeed. Is it for his sake that you find yourself in such reduced circumstances?\" Seeing he was no mortal, the loong prince said, \"Precisely. I have no wish to meet my end upon the Loong-Slaying Terrace. I asked a fortune-teller, and he said if I hide well and kill some westbound monkey, I may yet atone for my misdeeds and restore my honor.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man pondered this. \"A fortune-teller, you say? It was the words of a fortune-teller that led me to this place. There might be some strange design at work in this meeting of ours. Why not go with me to where I come from? It just so happens to be on the very road that leads to the west.\" The loong prince was overjoyed, but the young man added, \"I ask no small price, however. All the treasures in your hoard, they must be mine.\"\r\nSince the day of the young man's arrival, fewer and fewer were those who sought to plumb the river's depths in search of the pearl.

No longer fearful, the boy observed that, apart from the missing head, this figure resembled the benevolent monks he'd seen in the hamlet.\r\n\r\nSeeing Chengda unafraid, the Headless Monk plucked another chord. A cooling breeze passed over the boy's bruised leg. Looking down, Chengda found his wound miraculously healed. Clapping in joy, he exclaimed, \"Magic! Magic!\" The monk strummed again, and Chengda's torn trousers restored themselves. With that, the monk returned to his eerie song: \"Yellow Wind Ridge, a mighty ole' range, once buzzin' with joy and glee...\" and vanished into a gust of wind and sand.\r\n\r\nWhen the villagers returned to save Chengda, they found him pointing at the sand, exclaiming, \"It was an immortal!\" The adults scoffed, \"Nonsense, what sort of immortal lacks a head? You've seen a ghost, boy!\"",

One night, a small wasp flew in and heard his oath, but he paid it no mind.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the girl didn't come. Instead, a woman in green, adorned with an elaborate bun and possessing a fierce yet beautiful face, arrived with an entourage of insect guards.

Over time, whispers spread that the Zhus owed their skill to a jade shuttle, bestowed by the Red-clad Immortal.\r\n\r\nOne weaver was convinced that obtaining that shuttle would also secure his fortune. On a deep, dark night, he sneaked into the Zhu's workshop outside the city walls during the second watch.\r\n\r\nThe Zhus were rich enough to have their workshop sprawled wide and vast. In the dead of night, not a soul was in sight. The weaver crept through the yards of draping silks when a pure white light fell upon the center of the drying racks. The moon dimmed, and darkness swallowed all but that single, shining pillar joining earth and sky.\r\n\r\nThe weaver stumbled toward it and discovered the pillar of light was made of countless strands of silk. Two monstrous silkworms were spinning these strands into cocoons and hanging them on the drying racks. The cocoons' hooked feet grabbed the silk strands and passed a jade shuttle back and forth, weaving the exquisite fabric. Dazed, the weaver became fixated on the shuttle, convinced that owning it would endow him with the same power. But the cocoons impaled him with their sharp hooks in a blink of an eye. As he lay dying, he saw the worms crawling toward him. They carried him into the pillar of light and wrapped him a luminous cocoon.",

They tussled until they entered the hut. Crude and dirty, it had rough log tables and stone stools. There were no patrons inside, only a hunchbacked old man with a cane brewing tea. The young thief asked, \"How do you sell tea here with no one around, old man?\" The old man pointed to a dim village behind the hut. \"This humble one lives in the hilltop village. This hut serves but to eke out my living.\" He then served two bowls of thick, strange-smelling brew. The young thief reached for one, but the elder stopped him and asked the old man, \"Do you know of Zhu's Estate?\" The old man grinned, \"It lies within the village. Drink your tea, and I shall guide you there.\" The young thief beamed, but the elder grew warier. He snatched the bowl from the young one. \"I shall try it first.\" With that, he downed it in one gulp.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the tea hit his belly than he collapsed, writhing in agony. The young thief turned to the old man, only to witness his true form revealed as a hunchbacked, cane-wielding creature, its body entangled in silk. Lifting his eyes, he saw a colossal spider perched in the rafters, tugging the strands to prompt the bug to tap its cane with a resonant \"ting-ting.\" At this signal, the stone stools shifted and unfurled their legs. They became little stone spiders. They spat silk at the elder thief to entangle him. At this sight, the younger thief turned and fled, as if he had not heard his brother's pleas for help.",

Too far to see well, the woodcutter could only discern a red-clad guai whirling twin blades in dazzling spins and flips.\r\n\r\nEntranced, the woodcutter crept closer. He saw the acrobatic guai had legs tied behind its back, strings dangling from its feet. In a flash, he knew it was a puppetry trick.

He watched, spellbound. A chill on his neck jolted him out of the reverie. Reaching up to check, he found his fingers coated in green spittle. Looking up in horror, he was greeted by a myriad of eyes staring down at him.

Anyone struck by even a drop collapsed at once, writhing in pain.\r\n\r\nAs the guai had no remorse, the nun took out a wispy golden needle, prepared to destroy it. Only then did the snake show fear. It pleaded at once: \"I'm just a lesser herbalist guai from the mountain. In my basket outside is the antidote for them. Please, will you spare my life, immortal lady?\"\r\n\r\nHearing its sincere plea, the nun granted it mercy. The guai rummaged in its basket and handed her some small white pellets. \"These are the leaves of the pearl tree. They're rare in the mortal world and can cure all venoms.\" It fed one to each Daoist nun, and they recovered at once.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the temple always had tree pearls on hand, and many afflicted by venom came here to seek aid. But the high cost of a tree pearl meant many, unable to afford it, had to face the toxin's fatal outcome.",

As he entered the desolate, eerie village, he was overcome with regret. But as night fell and without knowledge of the mountain paths, he had no choice but to stay.\r\n\r\nHe found a less dilapidated house with intact eaves, barred all doors and windows, and lit a lamp to steel himself for a long night, planning to depart at first light. Fear gripped him at midnight, so he practiced his swordplay to calm his nerves. After a while, a deep voice arose from the darkness above the rafters: \"I am a yaoguai of this ridge. I meant to kill you, but with your fine swordsmanship and the official blade, you must be a yamen runner, yes?\"\r\n\r\nThe young man was startled but needed to voice his woes. He shared his ordeal with the yaoguai and drew sighs of empathy. The yaoguai said, \"I, too, was once an imperial guard, but a treacherous court official cursed me into a beetle to scrape by in these hills. I long for death, but I still wish to pass on my sword skills to someone worthy. Now, if you're willing to learn my skills, I offer to teach you.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man dared not to refuse. As he agreed, a beetle, over three meters tall, descended from the shadows. Its neck bore a thick carapace like a general's helm. The beetle wielded twin blades with a steadfast and forceful style that suited the young man's disposition. Overjoyed, the young man practiced with the beetle by the fading lamplight till dawn. As they parted ways, the beetle said kindly, \"The world these days is full of those lacking talent and virtue and ascending through flattery. Why tangle with them and sully yourself? Aim higher-a man should carve his own path.\" With a hearty laugh, the beetle left.\r\n\r\nThis encounter changed the young man. He resigned from his position at the yamen and enlisted in the border armies. His superb swordsmanship elevated him to the rank of general.

This angered the wolf guais native to Black Wind Mountain. To appease them, the Black Bear Guai pledged to revive old Lingxuzi. The wolf guais then had no choice but to endure in silence. Yet mere days after the awakening, the old wolf vanished, and no one had seen him since. Upon learning of this, the black bear did not look into the matter but allowed a senior grey wolf guai from the Kingdom of Shituo to take old Lingxuzi's seat and even his name.\r\n\r\nThis roused the local wolf guais to fury and launched protest after protest. To their surprise, the Wolf Sentinels, at the Black Bear Guai's behest, seized the lesser guais who led the unrest. The new Lingxuzi flew into a rage at these guais, threatening to devour them whole. They were spared this fate only by the timely arrival of Guangzhi, the Fireblade Wolf.\r\nThereafter, under the new Lingxuzi's command, the Wolf Sentinels led every patrol of lesser guais on the mountain.

They played tricks on him, and he always fell for it, slow and gullible as he was. Jinchi named him Guangzhi, \"the Great Wisdom\", hoping he would grow clever and sharp, so his fellow monks couldn't bully him. With Jinchi's care and teaching, Guangzhi learned to read, write, and abide by the monastic rules. Gradually, he assimilated into their ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, two monks arrived at the temple. One had a fair, devout countenance, while the other had a face covered in fur. They possessed a wondrous treasure: the Kasaya of Eversparks. Jinchi had never seen anything like it before and longed for it desperately. Hoping to repay Jinchi's teachings and nurturing, Guangzhi devised a plan to acquire it for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuangzhi never imagined his mistake would ignite red tides of flames that engulfed the temple he called home. Afterward, Jinchi took his own life, and Lingxuzi fell to the Jingubang. Even the Black Bear Guai surrendered and was taken by Guanyin. Guangzhi saw how many had suffered for his sake, and knew he had failed utterly at being human. He shed his monk robes and retreated to the mountains, repenting with Jinchi's teachings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his years of practice in the mountains, he forged a new weapon inspired by the raging flames he saw that night.

But no matter how hard Guangmou tried, Elder Jinchi never seemed to favor him as much as Guangzhi, even when he learned faster and trained harder. Guangmou consoled himself, believing this stemmed not from his own failings, but from the snake's ham-fisted meddling, which had turned the Elder against him. He found solace in the notion of returning to the mountains one day, when he could embrace his yaoguai nature, unshackled by such trivial concerns.\r\n\r\nGuangmou can still recall Jinchi's teachings: \"You can be too extreme, too uncompromising. Always leave some room and some things unfinished.\" But the day Jinchi saw the Kasaya of Eversparks, he desired it so intensely that he forgot his own words and wept long into the night. Guangmou saw the thought taking root in the old monk's heart: to kill for this prize. Everyone shied away from the idea, but Guangzhi boldly spoke the truth.\r\n\r\nGuangmou seethed with inexplicable rage. In his mind, a scheme within a scheme began to take shape. As Elder Jinchi drank tea with the two monks, Guangmou glimpsed an untamed malice in the monkey's eyes—a hunger for vengeance. Building on Guangzhi's gambit, Guangmou goaded and prodded, weaving a merciless plot that left no room for escape. The old monk was delighted, and for the first time, he acknowledged Guangmou's wit.\r\n\r\nWith his plan set, Guangmou knew that doom would strike that night. Summoning a gust of wind, he hid in the bamboo grove behind the mountain. As anticipated, a great fire broke out that night. But it failed to kill the two journeying monks as intended. Instead, it burned the entire temple to the ground.\r\n\r\nAlas, the world harbors such petty souls, capable of ensnaring the lofty and vanquishing them with cunning plots.

Monkey used his See-through Eyes to look around and laughed, \"Why do you monks here look so sickly and weak, with your spirits drained? Have you broken the precepts?\"\r\n\r\nIn Tang Monk's perception, the monks all wore brand-new kasayas and had tall, sturdy bodies. He considered Monkey's words to be mere nonsense and remarked, \"Don't speak so recklessly.\" Then, he turned to apologize to the monks. The monks themselves regarded Monkey's words as nonsense as well. Only two small monks, hidden in the crowd, dared not reveal themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Elder of the temple invited the master and disciple to the back chamber for tea. After the monks had taken their seats and the feast was laid out, the two small monks assisted the elderly monk inside.\r\n\r\nTang Monk bowed respectfully. The two exchanged a few pleasantries, and Tang Monk inquired, \"May I ask about your esteemed age, venerable elder?\" The old monk replied, \"Despite my many mistakes, I have lived to see my two hundred and seventieth year.\" When Monkey heard this, he laughed and said, \"Old skinflint! Why do I smell yaoguai in this temple?\"\r\n\r\nThe old monk did not answer. Tang Monk hastened to interject, \"This disciple of mine can be somewhat unruly at times. Please, do not take offense.\"\r\n\r\nA small monk was just then using an exquisite vessel to pour three cups of fragrant tea for them. Monkey stared at him and said, \"Where are you from, little monk?\" The small monk set down the tea and swiftly hid behind the old monk. Biting his finger, he said, \"This one has a furry face and a strange head. He's a bit scary.\"\r\n\r\nTang Monk glanced at Monkey and said, \"Mind your words! Don't offend people with your brashness!\" He then shifted the conversation by praising the tea and the vessels.\r\n\r\nThe old monk didn't seem to mind. Instead, he asked Tang Monk, \"Noble sir, hailing from the Emperor's capital, might you have any treasures that you could lend me for a mere glimpse?\"\r\n\r\nTang Monk declined repeatedly, but Monkey laughed and said, \"Master, isn't your kasaya itself a treasure? Why not allow him a glimpse?\"\r\n\r\nAll the monks laughed. Then they brought out twelve cases of kasayas, unfurled them, and hung them up for Tang Monk to see. But Monkey laughed and said, \"Very well, very well. Put them away. Bring ours out for a look too.\"\r\n\r\nTang Monk grabbed Monkey and tried hard to stop him, but Monkey said, \"Do not fret! Do not fret! I know what I'm doing!\" Without more words, he took out the kasaya for the monks to see.\r\n\r\nAs the old monk gazed upon such a wonder, his spirit was touched. He walked up to Tang Monk and knelt with tears in his eyes. \"This humble monk is verily bereft of fortune. My eyes are dim and clouded. I cannot see it clearly.\"\r\n\r\nMonkey laughed again and said, \"And how do you intend to inspect it clearly?\" The old monk replied, \"If you would be so kind and trusting, allow me to take it to the back chamber and study it carefully overnight. I shall return it to you tomorrow morning before your departure. May I know your thoughts on this?\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this, Tang Monk was startled and chided Monkey.

He cited a passage from ancient texts to persuade Red Loong: \"A loong cannot traverse without clouds.\"\r\n\r\nRed Loong believed this to be true. He embedded the censer on his back and burned his Will to forcibly create smoke from it. When one censer was not enough, he added another. Each time the censers emitted smoke, they greatly consumed his Will, yet the help they provided was very limited. Although Red Loong could use it to fly again, the flight could never compare to that of the old days. He could only reside wearily among the claw-woods.\r\n\r\nAlas, to think that the world harbors such vexing realities. A skill once mastered can fade with neglect. Such is the nature of all knowledge: if not applied, it withers away to nothing in the end. How lamentable!",

In just a few steps, he glided his way to the Keeper.\r\n\r\nThe Keeper looked closely and was sure they had never met. But judging from the Daoist's white hair, vibrating face, and bright eyes full of authority, the Keeper knew he was no ordinary mortal. Hastily, he greeted the Daoist, \"Daoist master, this humble Keeper pays his respects.\"\r\n\r\nThe old Daoist nodded slightly and passed his basket to the Keeper. The Keeper took a look and saw that the basket was filled with rare and mystical items, as well as miraculous herbs. He couldn't help but be startled and asked, \"How can a humble Keeper accept such a generous gift?\"\r\n\r\nThe Daoist smiled and said, \"I was just passing through this place, but I knew that soon, there would be a great upheaval in this mountain.

I cannot reveal myself, hence I rely on you to teach him, as a means of honoring our bond.\"\r\n\r\nThe Keeper was immensely grateful and bowed deeply in appreciation. The old Daoist returned the bow and was about to leave on a cloud. The Keeper hurriedly asked, \"May I inquire, Daoist master, from whence do you hail?\"\r\n\r\nBy the time the Keeper spoke, the Daoist had already vanished into the distance.

They always lit sandalwood incense, which symbolizes the temple, at their stalls and claimed that their crows were the spiritually enlightened ones from the temple.\r\n\r\nOne such Crow Diviner had a crow he had raised from a chick, which could communicate with him using specially made fortune sticks. Every day, he sent the crow to various parts of the city to observe people's lives. When clients came to seek fortunes, he would use the fortune sticks to inquire about information from the crows. He mixed this information with his own understanding of human affairs, weaving prophecies that were half-true, which often managed to deceive.\r\n\r\nOne day, an official came seeking a fortune, offering a large sum of money. The Crow Diviner told him that his official career would be prosperous and that he would reach a high position. Unexpectedly, the official not only failed to get promoted that year but was demoted instead. Enraged, the official brought his household servants to demand an explanation. The Crow Diviner used the information gathered by the crows to explain that the official had not spent enough money on temple renovation, which magically convinced him. The official, deeply believing in his abilities, even introduced the Crow Diviner to his colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe Crow Diviner amassed a considerable fortune through this, but he knew too many secrets of the officials and feared for his life.

I was patrolling the mountain and chanced upon him.\" The younger cub, overjoyed, said: \"Well done, Father! Teach me how you did it someday.\"\r\n\r\nEven as they spoke, the master of the cave sent word: \"Bring him in.\" Along with his sons, the Tiger Vanguard presented the Tang Monk before his master. \"My king,\" the vanguard began, \"I was honored with your command to patrol the mountain. By chance, I came across a monk, none other than the Tang emperor's sworn brother Tang Monk, bound for a journey to the West to seek the scriptures. I seized him and now offer him to grace your table.\" The master, surprised, demanded the full tale. The vanguard knelt to one side and recounted the fight.\r\n\r\n\"Hold,\" said the cave master. \"We do not eat him just yet.\" The vanguard protested: \"My king! It is against our nature to refuse the food before us.\" But his master replied: \"You do not understand. Eating him would be no great matter, but I fear the two disciples of his will come clamoring at our gate. It is safest to bind him to the windrest post in our rear garden. Wait three days, or five; if his disciples do not come to our gate, we will boil, steam, fry, or roast him at our leisure. There is no rush.\" The vanguard rejoiced. \"Wise beyond measure, my king! Wise indeed.\"\r\n\r\nThe two young tigers followed their father out. The elder muttered, \"Master has always devoured mortals without a second thought. There should be something he left unsaid.\" The younger added: \"He seems almost... afraid of that mortal.\" Their father snapped: \"You know nothing of the powers of our master! Long seasons have I served him. How could he shrink before any other?\" The brothers exchanged glances but said no more.\r\n\r\nScarcely half a day had passed when the master sent for them again. It was Sun Wukong challenging upon their gate. The Tiger Vanguard requested to face him, but the master demurred, \"I fear you cannot prevail against him. You may well be wounded, and you must not then impute blame unto me.\" The vanguard's sons urged him to reconsider, but he paid them no heed. \"Rest assured, you! Wait only until I return!\"",

It flared up in a trice, and a raging wind followed. As the third seal caught light, pealing thunder cracked from the lowering clouds. Both the Daoist and the yaoguai were startled, hands flying to their heads. As silence fell, they looked up to see trees blasted and split, while the storm above broke and scattered.\r\n\r\nThe Daoist froze, then scrambled to ready his brush for three more seals. The frog guai, unhurried, drummed its belly. The sky stood unchanged, but with each stroke, a dozen shafts of golden light lanced down, each striking close around the Daoist.\r\n\r\nTumbling and rolling, the Daoist could scarcely evade the beams of light. Then the frog guai gaped its maw and spat out a swarm of electrifying tadpoles. No matter how the Daoist dodged, they pursued him relentlessly until he fled in utter rout.\r\n\r\nAlas, in matters of renown, it is common to judge power by the intricacy and grandeur of one's methods.

Later, mortals drawn by the lush peaks and clear springs built a village amid the slopes. The elder tiger gained renown as a deity in the mountain with the principle: \"Devour the evil and shield the good.\"\r\n\r\nThe villagers built a Crouching Tiger Temple for the brothers, offering rich tributes that made their lives even more blissful. Yet long had the younger nursed a grievance; his elder brother reaped all the glory in people's words on the tigers in the mountain. He believed his brother earned this merely by dint of a few more years of life.\r\n\r\nAnother century turned and Yellow Wind Sage returned to Yellow Wind Ridge with a host of rat guais. The younger tiger declared that it was the Sage's negligence that had doomed their father. He clamored to slay the Sage in vengeance, urging his brother to drive off the rats. Deeming this just, the elder agreed. But in that fight, the Sage unleashed a vessel like a bodhisattva's severed head, with its gale sharp as an edge. In a single clash, the younger tiger fell grievously wounded. For the life of his little brother, the elder tiger at once cast down his arms and knelt in surrender. The Sage held no grudge, after learning the brothers' origin, he even bestowed upon the surrender the title of Vanguard.\r\n\r\nWhen the younger tiger woke and learned his brother now served as the Vanguard, he seethed in disbelief. The brothers quarreled bitterly until the younger stormed off, severing all ties with the only family he had left.\r\n\r\nIn the Tiger Vanguard's eyes, that yellow-furred rat had twice destroyed his family and left them broken and scattered. He hated him for that, but he was no fool. As long as the rat had protection from the higher ones, what more could a tiger do beyond venting his rage by devouring a few lesser rats each day?",

Each dusk as the evening bell tolled, the king sent men to the ramparts, where they beat upon a great drum and sound clarion calls, thus neutralizing the noise of the seas, which would otherwise be sharp enough to ravage babies in their cradles.\r\n\r\nThis drum, known as the Drum of the Setting Sun, was a gift from the Buddha and granted peace to the common folk. In gratitude, they filled their land with golden statues of all those enlightened, and the place came to be known as the Buddhist Land of Gold.\r\n\r\nYet as the years passed, the people's reverence for the Buddha grew to overshadow their regard for their secular ruler. This did not sit well with the King of the Flowing Sands. The chancellor, sensing his displeasure, petitioned for an end to Buddhism. And so the King decreed the razing of temples, the banishment of monks, and even the change of the kingdom's name.\r\n\r\nNot long after, at dusk when the great drum was struck, a monstrous insect erupted from the earth beyond the border. With terrible might, it ravaged the humble villages, leaving untold dead in its wake. From then on, the sound of the drum unfailingly drew that yaoguai from its den to wreak new ruin.\r\n\r\nThe people declared this to be karmic retribution, the result of the king's impiety. The chastened king halted his suppression of the Buddhist faith and sent armies to slay the creature. Yet what hope had mortal men to prevail against a foe so mighty and dreadful? After a bitter struggle, they could only manage to frighten it back to its lair.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there was an enlightened monk, yellow of hair and garb, passing through the land. This righteous soul could not bear to witness woe and injustice and aided the armies in slaying the wicked insect. In gratitude, the king honored him with the title of Royal Sage, and the monk resided in the kingdom for several years.\r\n\r\nIn time, the Royal Sage took his leave and resumed his wanderings.

If they heard that a brother had achieved something recently, they would make sarcastic remarks and express jealousy. Conversely, if a brother had made a mistake, they would mock and ridicule him, taking pleasure in his misfortune.\r\n\r\nConfused by such behavior, the lesser yaoguais in the cave approached Beetle Commander to seek an explanation.\r\n\r\nBeetle Commander explained, \"Their fear isn't about failing to marry a lady; it's that their brother's promotion will cut into their own benefits.\" Hearing this, the lesser yaoguais were even more perplexed.\r\n\r\nBeetle Commander continued, \"The Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master will not permit the Scorpion family to amass excessive power. Thus, if one of the four brothers ascends to the position of prince consort, the prospects for the others inevitably wane. This principle extends to the official roles within the cave. Take Scorpion Eldest, for instance; having gained the favor of the Second Madam, he faces the most exclusion from his brothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the eldest one is indeed more capable, while the others are not as competent,\" one lesser yaoguai chimed in.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.

Her mother waved her over, saying, \"The flowers in our abode are more beautiful than those in the upper realm.\" Meanwhile, outside the hut, the lesser yaoguai in charge of catering was waiting for her to decide the menu, and the steward overseeing the cocoons was waiting to report matters...\r\n\r\nThe eldest sister asked, \"Mother, is there something you wish to instruct me on?\"\r\n\r\nHer mother gently took her hand and said, \"I just want you to accompany me in admiring these flowers.\" She smiled warmly, adding, \"I worry they will wear you out.\" The eldest sister looked at her mother and was suddenly transported back to many years ago, when her mother had held her hand in the same way as they admired the peach blossoms together. The flowers were beautiful then, and so was her mother.",

Due to her straightforward and generous nature, she had the most interactions with the stewards outside the mountain and the lesser yaoguais in the Village of Lanxi.\r\n\r\nBecause she was busy with numerous affairs, the lesser yaoguais had fixed times to report and offer tributes to her. Most of these yaoguais, who were on good terms with her, both respected and feared her. They believed that their capable and strong-willed lady might one day become the lady of the cave. If that happened, anyone fortunate enough to marry into the family could become a lord by association. This caused much distress for the four scorpion princes residing in the cave, who were often the subject of idle gossip.\r\n\r\nThe second sister paid no mind to such rumors. Among the four sons of the Scorpionlord, she favored only those who were the most helpful to her.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, she had acquired a celestial vine seed from somewhere and planted it in her private courtyard within the cave, assigning the eldest scorpion prince to guard it.\r\n\r\nThe eldest scorpion prince, delighted, assumed this meant the second sister had feelings for him. One day, he approached the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, asking for help in matchmaking. The master laughed and shook his head, saying that a woman with such a strong will would only look down on him more if he sought someone else's help in proposing. He advised the prince to come up with a plan on his own.\r\n\r\nAfter returning to the cave, the eldest scorpion prince circled the celestial vine repeatedly, but he still hadn't figured out a way to win her heart.",

While the third sister taught with the weaving patterns in hand, the fifth sister followed with a punishing ruler. If any weaver was particularly unruly, the straightforward fifth sister would report them to the second sister, who would then seal the offender in a cocoon to be used as food.\r\n\r\nBecause the eldest and second sisters were often preoccupied with various affairs, the fifth sister had been following the third sister since childhood. The third sister was very quiet, so the fifth sister became her lively counterpart. The two sisters bickered and quarreled, but it made the days pass more easily.\r\n\r\nAmong the books the third sister often read were those strange mortal anecdote. She always found them fascinating and longed to experience those romantic scenes depicted.

The Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, coveting the power of his venom, promised to arrange marriages between the young spider yaoguais and the scorpion princes. Hence, he called forth Violet Spider and four of her daughters to meet them.\r\n\r\nOnce everyone was seated, the Daoist Master asked the princes to introduce themselves one by one.\r\n\r\nThe eldest prince stood up, thumping his chest, and declared, \"My skills were personally taught by my father. Among my brothers, I am the best bachelor. If all the sisters wish to marry me, don't let it cause any discord.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing the sisters frown, the second prince quickly stood up and interjected, \"Sisters, please forgive my brother's recklessness. Strong as he is, which I admit, I am no less capable. If you choose me as your husband, I will expand our domain and make it prosperous.\"\r\n\r\nThe Daoist Master was displeased by the second prince's ambition, and the sisters too remained non-committal, turning their gaze to the third scorpion son. Feeling the pressure of their stares, he reluctantly said, \"My brothers are all skilled, and my younger brother is also exceptional. Sisters, please consider carefully before making a choice.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth prince, disdainful of his third brother's lack of confidence, said, \"My third brother is a bit awkward in temperament. I hope you don't mind. Although I am younger, my future is promising. Choosing me is choosing the future.\"\r\n\r\nAfter hearing their self-introductions, the Daoist master asked the four daughters of the Zhu family to express their opinions one by one. The eldest sister spoke gently, \"With many sisters to look after, and our mother's illness, I cannot lay down this burden and let my sisters suffer. My marriage can wait a few more years.\"\r\n\r\nThe scorpions shook their heads, expressing regret. The second sister laughed coquettishly and said, \"I am busy managing the family business alone, with many financial gaps to fill. If any of you are willing to help bridge these gaps, I might consider marriage.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scorpionlord's mountain had long since fallen into ruin, with no wealth to speak of, so the second sister's words effectively ended the conversation. The third sister, holding a fan, said, \"I wish to marry someone with whom I can live in harmony. I love the poetry of Luo Yin. Have any of you read his works?\"\r\n\r\nIt's likely that the four princes didn't even know what poetry was, let alone who Luo Yin was. Consequently, everyone pinned their hopes on the fourth sister.\r\n\r\nSitting at the end, the fourth sister hummed softly out of boredom before speaking. \"My sisters, you were too polite, speaking so tactfully that they probably didn't even understand. This so-called meeting is just a scheme against us. We would end up with no gain, while they take our dowries and positions in our cave. How dare they consider us as the ones to be taken advantage of? They call themselves princes, yet none of them are noble. If they truly had any skills, why not earn their own fortunes instead of showing off and making fools of themselves here?\"\r\n\r\nAfter the fourth sister's outburst, the conversation at the table shifted to criticizing her.

The fifth sister was accompanying her second sister in the village, overseeing the work of the lesser yaoguais, when she spotted a traveling scholar seeking shelter from the rain. Feeling mischievous, she decided to play a trick on him.\r\n\r\nThe scholar, being somewhat naive, was worried about his bookcase getting soaked and rushed into the deserted village without noticing the yaoguais. He barely made it inside, bolted the door, and lit an oil lamp just as the rain began to pour heavily outside.\r\n\r\nGazing at the rain through the window, the scholar was inspired to recite poetry: \"Xu's land in turmoil, the court in disarray, Like thunderclaps in clear skies, they sway....\"\r\n\r\nA clap of thunder roared. The scholar thought he saw the window shake but paid it no mind until he finished reciting, feeling refreshed.\r\n\r\nAs he finished the line, he noticed the window lattice move again. Assuming it was the wind and rain, he hurriedly shut the window. After finishing his poem, feeling refreshed, he suddenly realized someone was knocking at the door.\r\n\r\nHe caught a glimpse of a graceful silhouette on the door's paper screen, and a sense of alarm washed over him as he entertained the thought that it could be a yaoguai. However, considering his own wretched and unremarkable existence, he somehow found solace in the idea of becoming a victim of beauty.\r\n\r\nAs the scholar hurriedly got up and flung the door open, expecting to see the stunning yaoguai, he was instead met with a horrifying sight—a ghost with disheveled hair and pus-filled eyes. Overwhelmed with terror, he let out a scream and instinctively pushed past her, desperate to escape the haunted house.\r\n\r\nOutside the door, the fifth daughter, playing with her delicate fingers, leaned gracefully against the wall, only to be knocked off balance. Angrily, she walked into the house, cursing the scholar for his rudeness, and happened to see an old bronze mirror on the desk.  Picking it up, she found out that the storm had washed away her makeup, leaving her face a patchwork of colors, and with her wet hair covering it, she looked truly frightening.

From this hidden egg, various creatures emerged, and it came to be known as the Elder Amourworm.\r\n\r\nEvery few days, the Elder Amourworm would produce insect eggs that resembled blood sacs.

Depending on the innate differences of the larvae, the host would undergo a transformation, turning into one of many types of insects.\r\n\r\nIf the eggs of the Elder Amourworm were not ingested, they would naturally hatch into an ordinary Amourworm. These ordinary Amourworm would spin silk to create cocoons, which they used to trap their prey. The cocoons contained potent toxins that caused the trapped creatures to experience a sensation of flying in the wind, as if floating on clouds, instead of feeling suffocated. However, prolonged exposure to these toxins led to abnormal changes in their bodies over time. Some practitioners attempted to use this method to temper their bodies and enhance their powers.

However, his quest took a dark turn when he was captured by yaoguais and thrown into the Bonevault. Falling into a deep pit, he landed in a lair of large insects. Despite suffering a broken leg, he managed to survive. As he looked around, all he could see were skeletons and remains, filling him with despair.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his despair, he felt a sharp pain in his leg. A massive centipede, as long as a person, had bitten him and torn off a piece of his flesh to devour. Filled with terror, the young man instinctively grabbed a stone and viciously crushed the centipede until it burst apart. Only then did he realize that the stone he used was a human skull, which he quickly discarded.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, he noticed that the pain in his injured leg had subsided. Curious, he applied some of the centipede's pus to a scraped arm, and the pain diminished, likely due to the numbing effect of the venom. This revelation sparked an idea in his mind. He tore strong silk threads from the cocoons surrounding the pit and found two leg bones to serve as support for his broken leg.\r\n\r\nExhausted from the ordeal, he rested, but soon heard rustling sounds around him. He searched for the source of the noise, but it abruptly ceased. Suddenly, a giant white ball descended from above, bouncing several times before unfurling into a massive centipede, hundreds of times larger than the first one. Swiftly, the young man curled himself into a ball, mimicking the centipede's movements to confuse the colossal creature.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, more objects fell into the pit—empty skins and remains. From them emerged a swarm of smaller centipedes, feasting on the discarded scraps. They passed by the young man, mistaking him for one of their own.

Shortly after, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master personally visited and placed two egg-like objects within the arms, instructing the yaoguais to guard them diligently.\r\n\r\nAt first, the arms exuded a thick, foul-smelling fluid. After some time, the fluid dried up, forming a thick blood membrane that encased the arms.\r\n\r\nYears passed, and from a distance, one could see something writhing within the blood membrane, as if something was growing inside, eager to break free. Exactly ten years later, two insects emerged from the eggs. Their bodies resembled bees, their tails like hands, and their venomous spit could kill any bird or beast and wither any plant it touched.\r\n\r\nThe Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master rejoiced at the news and arranged a grand feast to celebrate.

Fortunately, he was no longer as helpless as before and managed to navigate deeper into the cave.

The mountain deity cried out, waving his incense sticks wildly. The three ghosts, being clumsy, couldn't dodge and got hit. Seeing their clothes catch fire, the three ghosts forgot about the mountain deity and started blaming each other.\r\n\r\nAs they quarreled, a burst of laughter echoed from the cliff. A young boy with red skin and white hair sat there, watching them as if enjoying a show.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassed and angry, the three ghosts and the mountain deity temporarily set aside their differences and attacked the young boy. The boy, finding it amusing, wielded a sharp spear and sparred with them.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, the mountain deity's smoke perfectly concealed the clumsy bodies of the three ghosts, while the ghosts' lightning provided opportunities for the mountain deity to attack. Together, they managed to fight the young boy for several rounds. It wasn't until the boy used his Samadhi Fire that they fell to the ground, begging for mercy.\r\n\r\nThen, Red Boy told them, \"From now on, these six hundred miles of mountains are mine.

If anyone tried to talk her into adhering to manners and propriety, she would laugh and curse them until they left in disgrace. Yet, Xu found this amusing and indulged her in every way, spoiling her with affection.\r\n\r\nOne day, Xu was returning to the capital to report on his duties. Fearing that their carriage might be attacked by bandits, he hired a large boat to transport his family, servants, and belongings back to the capital. That night, the sound of fighting suddenly erupted on the boat. It turned out that a yaoguai had sneaked aboard under the cover of darkness. Soon, a terrifying figure with horns and jagged teeth appeared. He wore a tattered cloth around his waist, held a pot-shaped shield in his left hand, and wielded an iron whip in his right, glaring menacingly at everyone.\r\n\r\nXu and his wife trembled in fear, but the concubine stood tall and unafraid, loudly scolding the yaoguai for his rudeness. The yaoguai was taken aback for a moment, then sighed and said, \"Even in human form, you are so arrogant. Truly, you are one of us, a Yaksha.\"\r\n\r\nThe concubine burst into laughter and said, \"Nonsense! I intended to play for a while longer, but now you've ruined everything. Fine, let's kill them all and leave together.\" With that, she transformed into a creature identical to the yaoguai.\r\n\r\nXu finally realized that he had brought a yaoguai into his home.\r\n\r\nJust as the two yaoguais were about to kill Xu and his family, a female voice rang out, \"Even though your kingdom has fallen and you were forced to seek shelter in the east, you should not behave so rudely. Why not follow me into the mountains for your practice?\" Just when the two yaoguais were ready to resist, a woman descended onto the bow of the boat, holding a precious fan. With a powerful wave of the fan, she immobilized them in the wind.\r\n\r\nAfter this terrifying experience, Xu never dared to take another concubine.",

Without asking him a word, everyone assumed he had come to join them, as a disciple, so they took extra care of him.\r\n\r\nWhile at the temple, the Daoist observed the others practicing. Through self-studying, he managed to learn a few techniques, such as \"Meteor-smash\" and \"Stallion-spring\". Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, hearing the Daoist's tales of his travels, recognized his quick wit and boldness and decided to take him as a disciple. Overwhelmed by the honor, the Daoist immediately knelt and acknowledged his master. That night, however, he quietly packed his belongings and left the temple, resuming his quest to find the world's rarest frogs.\r\n\r\nThe next day, when the Master was informed of his departure, he laughed and said, \"He has small ambitions and is unrestrained by conventions. One of a kind indeed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Daoist continued his journey and arrived at the Flaming Mountains. At the foot of Cooling Slope, he encountered a large, fiery-red frog. They were about to engage in battle when a purple-skinned lion-dog emerged from a cave behind the slope.\r\n\r\nThis purple-skinned beast was extremely aggressive. Seeing the two of them lingering near its cave, it charged straight at them. The Daoist was initially intimidated by its presence, but the large frog kicked the beast away, saving his life.\r\n\r\nAngered by the frog's interference, the purple-skinned beast turned to attack it. The frog opened its mouth, and with a gulp, spewed a stream of fire, forcing the beast to retreat several steps.\r\n\r\nSeizing the chance, the Daoist used all the techniques he had recently learned, \"Meteor-smash\" and \"Stallion-spring\", against the beast. Seeing them join forces, the beast fled back into the cave.\r\n\r\nThe Daoist pursued it into the cave, only to find the interior remarkably cool, a stark contrast to the scorching heat of Flaming Mountains.\r\n\r\nBefore long, the frog also hopped into the cave and hid in a shady corner. The Daoist realized that although the frog could breathe fire, its nature made it fear the mountain's heat, and the cave was the cool place it sought to rest.\r\n\r\nEven this yaoguai had a desire to live. With this surprising understanding, the Daoist felt a surge of compassion and abandoned any thoughts of killing it. He sheathed his sword and left the cave.",

Red Boy ordered some minions to bring out five small carts. The minions arranged the carts according to the five elements: gold, wood, water, fire, and earth.

As he approached the village, he saw several women playing with balls under a pavilion. Invited by them into their home, he was suddenly thrown to the ground, tied up with ropes, and hung from a beam in the most uncomfortable manner.\r\n\r\nWhile climbing trees and branches, Sun Wukong turned back and saw a glimmer of light, realizing that his master must have encountered yaoguais. He summoned the local keeper for details and learned that the glimmer was from the celestial bathing spring, which had been taken over by seven spider guais. Knowing that they bathe three times a day, Sun Wukong transformed into an eagle, swooped down, and stole all of their clothes from the rack.\r\n\r\nBajie, seeing so many women's clothes, persistently inquired and learned that seven guais were bathing. Overjoyed, he rushed to the spring. Without any hesitation, he stripped off his black garb and jumped into the water, transforming into a catfish guai. The spiders tried to catch him yet none of them succeeded.\r\n\r\nRecognizing one of them as an old acquaintance, Bajie mischievously swam around her legs. He floated and dived around her until he was out of breath and hazed.\r\n\r\nThe guais, retreating to their cave, fetched some old clothes and called upon their seven adopted sons to guard the house while they headed to the Temple of Yellow Flowers to seek aid. Meanwhile, Bajie retraced his steps and reunited with the fellowship. Together, they defeated the insect sons and freed their master. Without delay, they hurried to the Temple of Yellow Flowers. The temple master, who had practiced alongside the seven spider guais, learned that Tang Monk was a monk of ten lifetimes' merits and that his fellow spiders were humiliated, prepared four cups of poisoned tea, intending to exact revenge on the fellowship and ultimately consume Tang Monk.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sun Wukong saw through the ruse, overturned the tea cups, and defeated the spider guais, forcing them to retreat. The Daoist master then engaged, prompting Wukong to order Bajie to eliminate the seven spider guais in his stead. Following his command, Bajie wielded his rake and struck down each of the spiders, sparing only the last one. Remembering their brief affair in the water, he hesitated and, with a final thrust of his rake into the ground, told her to flee for her life.",

Consequently, the golden-armored male scorpion also fell out of favor.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the queen no longer sought his company, the male scorpion, with high self-esteem, took his children and moved outside the mountain, severing ties with her.\r\n\r\nLater, when the journeyers passed through the Kingdom of Women, the Scorpion Queen, true to her nature as a Guai of Desire, kidnapped Tang Monk, which cost her her life when Sun Wukong summoned the Dawnstar, whose crow killed her instantly.

The kind-hearted fisherman, seeing the old man's plight, offered him a free ride across the river and even gave him two fresh fish for a meal. Grateful, the old man performed a divination on the spot and said, \"In a few days, a young man wearing a bamboo hat and a white robe will pass by. Under no circumstances should you let him come to your village. On the day he arrives, do not conduct any business on the river, or you will lose your life.\"\r\n\r\nAfter delivering these cryptic words, the old man vanished from the boat, leaving the fisherman both astonished and frightened. Yet, he etched the old man's warning deep into his heart. A few days later, while fishing, he indeed saw a man on the riverbank who matched the old man's description exactly. The man, claiming to be weary from his travels, asked the fisherman if he could take him to the nearby fishing village to rest. The fisherman initially wanted to refuse but then decided to take the man to a neighboring village downstream instead. After dropping the man off, the fisherman docked his boat and dared not return to the river.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the man pulled a black bowl from his sleeve and threw it into the river. As soon as the bowl hit the water, a massive, pitch-black fish emerged, and a fierce storm erupted, with waves surging sky-high. The fisherman fled without looking back. Some time later, he heard that a severe plague had struck the neighboring village, killing many people. Initially feeling a sense of relief, he soon learned that refugees from the neighboring village had brought the plague to his own village, and they too were not spared.",

After all the suffering he had endured over the years, unless he could vent his anger, the only way to resolve the siege of Flaming Mountains would be to break his spine.\r\n\r\nThus, she came here—\r\n\r\nFor revenge.\r\n\r\nHow to exact it?\r\n\r\nShe had no idea, her mind a blank void.\r\n\r\n\"Lady Rakshasi, the master summons you inside.\" Ananda stood at the temple door, his voice as gentle as ever.\r\n\r\nShe straightened her back, gripping the Plantain Fan tightly in her hand, and hoarsely replied, \"Thank you, Venerable.\"\r\n\r\nAs she walked into the hall, flanked by the Eight Great Vajras and five hundred Arhats, she seemed to hear faint laughter, but all she saw in her peripheral vision were solemn and dignified figures.\r\n\r\nReaching the base of the lotus throne, she knelt with her head held high, clutching the fan tightly.\r\n\r\n\"Rakshasi, what brings you here to seek an audience with me?\"\r\n\r\nShe remained silent, gripping the fan with all her might, ready to unleash its divine wind at any moment. \r\n\r\nThe hall was deathly quiet.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were on her; she could feel the Vajras glaring with their angry eyes, the Arhats staring with their wrathful gazes, and all the divine figures transforming into fierce visages.\r\n\r\n\"I...\" She lowered her head. \"I...\"\r\n\r\n\"I greet you on behalf of my master.\"\r\n\r\nA booming laughter echoed, deafening. Within that laughter, she heard the cries of an infant, the innocent giggles of a child, the roars of an adolescent, and the cycle of blooming and withering flowers, the growth of grass and the flight of orioles over millennia.\r\n\r\nShe heard the embers extinguishing in the Flaming Mountains.",

Anyone attempting to cross the mountains, even if they had a head of iron and a body of steel, would melt into a puddle. Despite this, some merchants, driven by the lure of profit, attempted to cross the mountains to trade horses in the west.\r\n\r\nYet, upon setting foot in the Flaming Mountains, they were beset by guais. None survived, except for one horse, which bolted and ran for sixty miles after sensing the danger. Exhausted and thirsty, it collapsed at the gate of a manor. An old man named Xu, who lived alone in the manor, took pity on the horse. He took it in, fed it, and cared for it. Gradually, the horse regained its strength and grew robust.\r\n\r\nThe horse was intelligent and always responded to the old man's kindness with grateful neighs. The old man, seemingly able to understand the horse, said, \"I was the eldest in my family. If you wish to join me, you shall be called Ma Er, as my second brother.\" The old man treated Ma Er with genuine affection, often going hungry himself to ensure Ma Er was well-fed. Ma Er took note of this and remembered it in his heart.\r\n\r\nThe Flaming Mountains were in perpetual drought, and without the Plantain Fan, there was no spring to sow and no autumn to harvest. Moreover, Xu was getting on in years. One day, as he was feeding Ma Er as usual, he suddenly collapsed by the stable.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, Ma Er hoisted the old man onto his back and galloped towards the Plantain Cave on the Emerald Mountain. He ran non-stop for over seven hundred and seventy miles. Yet, by the time they reached the Emerald Mountain, the old man had already passed away. Heartbroken, Ma Er refused to return to the manor and began wandering the mountains.\r\n\r\nSeeing Ma Er's gentle nature, the yaoguais in the mountains often bullied him. Ma Er endured their taunts and jests, never getting angry or speaking back. Homeless and unbannered, he lived this way for many days, his once robust body growing thin again.\r\n\r\nOne day, as he was scavenging along the mountain path for scraps discarded by the lesser yaoguais, he saw an old bull sleeping by the roadside, with fire burning on his fur. Alarmed, Ma Er tried to wake the bull but to no avail. With no other choice, Ma Er hoisted the old bull onto his back and ran towards the Plantain Cave.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, somehow, the yaoguais, seeing Ma Er carrying a burning bull, were furious. They shouted and attacked, but Ma Er, ignoring them, charged ahead, sustaining many injuries.\r\n\r\nIt was only when they finally reached the Plantain Cave that Ma Er realized the burning bull was the Bull King, who had got drunk somewhere with friends and was now in a deep sleep. With a few calls from Rakshasi, the Bull King was startled awake from his drunken stupor. Seeing the battered Ma Er, the Bull King laughed heartily, \"You are one tough horse! From now on, join my banner, and you shall be named Ma Tianba!\"\r\n\r\nThus, Ma Er became Ma Tianba. He trained and practiced martial arts under the Bull King, growing stronger and eventually becoming a great general under the Bull King's command.",

Today, the Queen Mother of the West was hosting a lotus-viewing banquet.\r\n\r\nAs Admiral Tianpeng walked past the gate, he saw a tall, burly man blocked by a celestial maiden. \"Admiral Curtainraiser,\" the maiden said in a polite but cold manner, \"without a handwritten invitation from the Queen Mother, you cannot sit by the pool. If you don't mind, why not take a seat in the side hall and have some tea.\" The burly man responded in obedience, but his gaze fixed in the main hall.\r\n\r\nAt such behavior, Tianpeng subtly shook his head, a faint smile playing on his lips. He presented his invitation to the other maiden at the gate and strode in, his head held high.\r\n\r\nThe banquet was in full swing, with celestial officials exchanging toasts, their joyful laughter resonating throughout the hall, creating an atmosphere of mirth and merriment.\r\n\r\nTianpeng, an admiral who guarded the celestial river, seldom attended such festive gatherings. However, he managed to greet everyone as if he was well-acquainted with them all, all while mindful not to overindulge in wine.\r\n\r\nThe God of Longevity stood beside the Queen Mother, stroking his beard and chuckled, \"Such extravagance. I wonder how would the Peach Banquet surpass it.\"\r\n\r\nA constellation officer, standing nearby, chuckled at the Elder's concern, \"Elder, such worries are in vain. With the allure of those nine-thousand-year peaches, even a casual arrangement of tables outside the Celestial Gate would draw the dignitaries from across the three realms, be they noble or humble, eager to partake in a taste.\"\r\n\r\nA red-faced immortal sneered, \"It's not the peaches they seek, but rather to bow before the Jade Emperor and the Three Supremes, and worship the Buddhas of the west. Such assemblies are scarce pretexts for them to curry favor and bask in the company of the divine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen Mother spoke with solemn dignity, \"The Peach Banquet is no trivial matter. Our gathering today is but a prelude, a rehearsal of the rites and rituals that must be executed with exactness and reverence.\"\r\n\r\nUpon concluding her speech, the Queen Mother signaled to the Lord of Luna with a glance. With a few claps of his hands, a group of maidens dressed in white entered the hall.\r\n\r\nThe maidens took their positions by the Jade Pool and began to play instruments, sing, and dance. Among them, one dancer, with hair like silver, and a dress like clouds, stood out with her exceptional grace. Tianpeng had never seen the beautiful celestial maidens so closely, and he was fascinated.\r\n\r\nA celestial maiden in a violet gauze dress, holding an exquisite cup of wine with both of her hands. \"Admiral,\" she softly called.\r\n\r\nDrenched in his fascination, Tianpeng took the cup from her hands, yet his gaze never left the white dancing sleeves.\r\n\r\nAfter the dance concluded, Tianpeng regained senses. He rose up to toast the Queen Mother, yet the queue was long; by the time he reached the end of it, he found himself already outside the gate.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he heard someone shouting, \"Shoes! His shoes!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked over and saw two celestial officers supporting a drunken monkey as they hurried past.\r\n\r\nTianpeng thought to himself, When will I ever get to be as drunk as that monkey?",

After the kingdom's collapse, the yakshas were forced into exile. The ceremonial archers, who once guarded the royal entourage, clung to their former glory and refused to shed their ornate armor. Despite their exceptional archery skills, their slow shooting speed and lack of close combat prowess made their exile particularly harsh.\r\n\r\nDue to their inadequate strength, they resorted to ambushes from the shadows. The abbot assigned them to the Pagoda Realm for rigorous training. They endured daily torment there, especially when the Mani Wheel played its beguiling chants, driving everyone mad. During these times, the Blade Monks would seize the opportunity to behead the archers with their large blades, leaving the yaksha archers desperate for a way to fight back.\r\n\r\nThey sought guidance from various sources and frequently challenged the Blade Monks, only to be defeated repeatedly. One day, some blind monks came to oversee the Pagoda Realm. They had blinded themselves to pursue the path to ultimate bliss, yet their martial arts were incredibly refined. The yaksha archers asked for their advice, and the monks replied, \"Aim too carefully and you will lose the initiative. Learn from me; gouge out your eyes, and you will shoot from the heart, never missing your mark.\"\r\n\r\nWith the only other option available to them being annihilation, the archers adopted this drastic measure, gouging out their eyes. After this, the Blade Monks rarely targeted them. When asked why, a Blade Monk replied, \"Who would want to go up against a madman? It's safer to just find another opponent.\"",

One day, a luxurious ferry sailed down the river near the village, more splendid than anything the villagers had ever seen. At the bow stood a plump monk in a yellow robe, radiating golden light. The villagers believed he must have been enlightened.\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of the ferry, the temple in the mountains grew larger and larger, and the young man's grain trade flourished.\r\n\r\nOne day, the young man went to trade grain and did not return for over a month. The girl, worried, inquired about the temple's location and went there to find him. When the young man finally returned to the village, they missed each other, and the girl disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe young man gathered some brave villagers to search for her in the mountains. They found no trace of her but came across a towering pagoda by the riverbank. The young man led them there to rest.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the pagoda, the door suddenly opened. Curious, someone peeked inside and screamed. Behind the door was a dungeon extending deep underground, seemingly holding many people. The villagers, filled with righteous anger, stormed into the pagoda. After a few steps, they heard a loud bang, and the door vanished. Strange-looking yaoguais with scythes and huge bellies emerged from the prison, laughing wickedly.\r\n\r\nOne of them threw a bag of silvers to the young man and then eagerly leapt forward, swinging his scythe and cutting the nearest villagers into pieces.

After some discussion, the couple decided to keep him.\r\n\r\nAt first, the couple treated the child very well. But within half a year, due to his strange appearance, the villagers began to gossip and called him \"Ugly Slave.\" The old couple, feeling ashamed, also started to treat him less kindly and even called him the same way as the villagers did. Within two years, his skin turned a dark green, and the couple made him wear thick clothes to cover his entire body, forbidding him to take them off even in the scorching heat.\r\n\r\nThree years later, the Ugly Slave grew more robust, and horns began to sprout from his head. The old man, increasingly fearful, confined him to the woodshed.

Such attempts were numerous and often futile.\r\n\r\nTrials and tribulations made the golden lotuses gradually realized that their original form, the auspicious flowers indicating the Buddhas's presence, had a better chance of success. Hence, they went to the temples, using the auspiciousness to lure people into picking them, only to devour them afterward.\r\n\r\nAlas, if one seeks to perceive the world solely in pursuit of quick success, how complex the world becomes! Cause and effect are intertwined, and fate is mysterious. Every step taken is predestined.",

Back in our place, the Lady is too strict to allow any fun.\"\r\n\r\nA proud insect guai responded, \"Our ladies in the cave often host banquets to keep the mistress company.

Look over there, those four scorpions; their family is in decline, and their descendants are unworthy. Only one is somewhat acceptable, but not one of our ladies would marry him.

However, he was deeply displeased that a guai sage had stolen his shine. Using the pretext of the rodent guais causing trouble, he rallied court officials to petition for the Royal Sage's removal.\r\n\r\nSeveral upheavals ensued in the court, resulting in the deaths of many loyal to the prince, and even the Third Prince left in anger. Yet, the king's trust in the sage remained unshaken.\r\n\r\nOn the sage's birthday, the entire kingdom worshiped his statue, and even the king paid a visit to the Temple of Royal Sage himself to offer incense and prayers. Unable to contain his fury, the First Prince overturned the incense table in public.\r\n\r\nSuch an affront to royal authority could not be tolerated. Enraged, the king imprisoned the prince. The sage, however, was not angered and even spoke many good words for the Brave General. Learning of the sage's intercession, the prince became even more convinced that he was a deeply scheming evil guai, cursing him incessantly in his cell. The king, upon hearing this, grew more antagonized by his unruly son. Hence, he decreed that the prince needed strict discipline, ordering that his meals be delivered to the cell door thrice daily, with no visitors allowed.\r\n\r\nInitially, the prince was very stubborn, but over time, he softened and began to plead for mercy. Yet, he remained defiant in his heart, constantly plotting to kill the rodents and avenge himself once he was free.\r\n\r\nOne day, his meal was late, and he was growing anxious. Then he heard the sound of a key turning, and the cell door unexpectedly opened.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting for a while and seeing no one enter, he walked out himself. To his astonishment, the guards and officials bustling about outside were no longer human. They all became rats dressed in robes.\r\n\r\nThe prince thought it was that the sage had led the rodent guais to usurp the throne, and in his panic, he charged into his father's golden hall—\r\n\r\nA short, stout rat, speaking in his father's voice, called out to him.

Hearing this, Tiger Brother devised a plan. He attributed his elder brother's deeds to himself and convinced the man to bring his son, claiming he could treat the boy.\r\n\r\nWhen they first met, the boy's face was pale. Too weak to climb down the well by himself, the boy was carried by his father by tying him with a hemp rope to lower him safely into the well. Tiger Brother examined the boy and confirmed that his spirit had been disturbed by the Samadhi Wind. Without stopping the wind and sand, no one could cure him.\r\n\r\nTiger Brother remembered that his brother had given him a magical gourd. Drinking from it could strengthen one's vitality, and he thought it might keep the boy alive.\r\n\r\nAfter the boy drank the water Tiger Brother gave him, he indeed regained some energy and could speak. Despite his long illness, the boy was very polite. He thanked Tiger Brother for his help, praising him endlessly. In the boy's admiring gaze, Tiger Brother found a long-lost sense of satisfaction. He instructed the father and son to come daily to take a sip from the gourd, or the boy would relapse.\r\n\r\nAfter several visits, the boy's condition improved significantly. He could walk around and even play in the village, making many friends. Each time he came to drink from the gourd, he would call Tiger Brother \"Tiger God\" and share his new food, toys, and experiences.\r\n\r\nDespite his initial wariness of the father and son, Tiger Brother gave the boy his gourd when he observed that the man was sincere and honest. He instructed the boy to keep the gourd close. Heeding his words, the boy's health improved even more.\r\n\r\nYet, abruptly, the father and son stopped visiting. Tiger Brother waited for several days, thinking they might have run off with the gourd.

But I find it interesting to take in what ordinary people would not.\" With that, he accepted these strange fish as his disciples, clothed them, and taught them how to read and transform into human forms. He even allowed them to practice freely within the realm of the New West.\r\n\r\nOne of the fish guais was particularly robust and had a fierce temperament. After mastering some techniques, it would ambush at various spots in the temple, waiting for opportunities to attack Yellowbrow when he went out, striking without mercy. Yellowbrow, however, enjoyed these encounters and would seriously engage in combat with the fish guai. Most of the time, he would simply sweep it out of the hall with a swing of his Spikeshaft Cudgel.\r\n\r\nDespite repeated defeats, the fish guai realized that close combat was futile. It independently devised a technique involving throwing snowballs with its limbs, hitting targets with uncanny accuracy. Once, in the Forest of Felicity, even Yellowbrow was hit several times by snowballs, nearly freezing into an ice block.\r\n\r\nInstead of getting angry, Yellowbrow was delighted and unprecedentedly bestowed a new title upon the He Luo fish guai—\"Monk from the Sea.\" He then assigned it the task of cleaning the inner courtyard, which conveniently allowed it to ambush anyone it wished to, especially Yellowbrow himself.\r\n\r\nAh, though they followed the same master, the disciples' experiences and purposes in their practice varied greatly, leading to vastly different treatments.",

Later, the Father of Stones left the mountain for some reason, and the Son of Stones went in search of him, leaving the Mother alone.\r\n\r\nThe Mother of Stone was never fond of violence. When the Yellow Wind Sage gave her the essence, he entrusted her with the task of diligently taking care of the mountain's inhabitants. She took this responsibility seriously and worked hard. When the Journeyers passed through Yellow Wind Ridge, the Yellow Wind King captured Tang Monk, forcing Sun Wukong to seek Bodhisattva Lingji's help to capture him and take him back to Mount Lingshan. Years passed, and upon the return of the Sage, the ridge was populated with many stone guais. Among them was a particularly strong and robust stone guai, which he learned was created by the Mother of Stone with all her might to guard the cave.\r\n\r\nOne day, the Yellow Wind Sage personally came to visit Mother of Stone, only to be blocked by the stone guai. Alarmed by their disobedience, he feared it might become a threat. Hence, he summoned the newly appointed Tiger Vanguard to eliminate the strong stone guai.\r\n\r\nTiger Vanguard agreed but was reluctant to fight them. They had once worked together to rebuild the mountain, and he knew the strong stone guai was highly respected by the other stone guais, who saw him as an elder brother. He advised the stone guai, \"Brother, we've endured much to reach this point. If I can help, I will. I've arranged everything; you just need to retreat into the valley and keep a guard on Shigandang, no need for anything vicious. Today, I come with kind words, but tomorrow, it might be a battle. Though we have some skills, we are no match for the yellow-furred rat. Why not join me as a vanguard and keep things as they are?\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, the Yellow Wind Sage appointed the strong stone guai as Stone Vanguard, ordering him to lead the stone guais to retreat and guard the valley.

In time, they awakened, transforming into sentient stone guais. Among them, two, through advanced cultivation, were bestowed with the title of mountain deities.\r\n\r\nOne day, for reasons unknown, several Buddha heads emerged from the ground on the ridge. These heads, complete with eyes, ears, mouths, noses, and even flexible muscles, were profoundly bizarre. Upon seeing any living creature, they would scream loudly; and if approached, they would swallow the creature whole.\r\n\r\nOne stone guai, finding these Buddha heads strange and dangerous, decided to eliminate them to protect the mountain's inhabitants. It rammed into one of the Buddha heads, crushing it into a pulp. However, the flesh adhered to the stone guai's body and soon grew into a new stone Buddha head.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment on, the stone guai's temperament completely changed. It began to roam the mountain, searching for other Buddha heads, crushing them, and allowing them to grow on its back. As the number of Buddha heads on its body increased, so did its size. It no longer took nourishment from the universe but instead fed on the mountain's living creatures to cultivate. The other stone guais could not defeat it; a single punch from it would shatter them into pieces, destroying their souls.\r\n\r\nWhen the yellow-furred rat and his followers left the Kingdom of Flowing Sands and passed through Yellow Wind Ridge, they encountered the mountain deities leading several stone guais to drive the infested stone guai away. The yellow-furred rat seemed to understand the nature of those Buddha heads well. A strong sense of righteousness led him and his followers into battle.\r\n\r\nIn a great victory, the yellow-furred rat not only destroyed the infested stone guai but also eradicated all the flesh Buddha heads in the mountain. He extracted the essence from the guai and divided it between the two brave mountain deities. He also gouged out the eyeballs from the Buddha heads and placed them in the valley as a seal.\r\n\r\nThe mountain's inhabitants greatly admired the Yellow Wind Guai.

However, this was not the case in Yellow Wind Ridge.\r\n\r\nYears ago, when the Yellow Wind Sage led his followers to subdue Buddha-headed stone guai, he sought the keeper's assistance in battle. The keeper, however, chose to remain a bystander. Consequently, when the guai's essence was divided and distributed, only the mountain deities received a share, leaving the keeper empty-handed and filled him with resentment.\r\n\r\nKnowing his own abilities were mediocre and lacking any significant divine powers or backing, the keeper believed that obtaining the essence would grant him great powers, akin to those of the mountain deities. Thus, when the Father of Stones departed and the Yellow Wind Sage surrendered, he harbored malicious intentions towards the Mother of Stones.\r\n\r\nHe observed the valley for many days, noting how the stone guais were busy moving mountains and shaping stones, while the Mother of Stones merely issued commands from her stone cave. This gave him an idea.\r\n\r\nOne day, he transformed himself to resemble a stone guai and pretended to be on an errand to approach the Mother of Stones. His plan was to ram into her abdomen with all his might to, hoping to crack her open and extract the essence. However, just as he leaped, the Mother of Stones let out a piercing scream, and several stone guais emerged from the ground nearby.\r\n\r\nDistracted, the keeper missed his mark and only managed to create a crack on the Mother of Stones' chest. Realizing his plan had been exposed, he clung to her, attempting to absorb her power with all his might. By the time the stone guais pried him off, he had absorbed half of her essence.\r\n\r\nEnraged, the stone guais chased and attacked him relentlessly. The keeper, unable to escape, tried to revert to his original form to fight back. To his dismay, he found himself unable to change back, likely because the stone essence had transformed him into a stone. The stone guais continued to batter him until he was buried in the ground.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, the keeper lost all hope and resigned himself to being a broken stone in the valley. Yet, he still believed that if he could obtain the other half of the essence, he might be able to transform back.",

The Keeper then directed him to a narrow, winding path, instructing him to proceed quickly.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Keeper's advice, the traveler safely crossed the ridge and the mountain. Observing this, the Keeper laughed and said, \"The art of divination lies not in the omens but in the heart.

Now in his sixties, he had fallen gravely ill, showing signs of being near the end of his life. His son sought out the Daoist and invited him to treat his ailing father.\r\n\r\nThe Daoist had a yellow dog that he kept by his side at all times. This time, he brought it along to the Chen residence. The Daoist prepared many special pills for Mr. Chen. Although the household servants thought he was merely going through the motions, they dared not say much and watched from the sidelines.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, after taking the pills, Mr. Chen gradually began to eat and drink a little, and his breathing became smoother, showing signs of recovery. Yet, just when everything was getting better, in one of the Daoist's pill-making sessions, his furnace exploded, killing him in the process.\r\n\r\nThe household servants came to clean up the Daoist temporary quarters, lamenting the whims of fate. To their astonishment, they saw the Daoist's yellow dog, dressed in his clothes, walking out of the room. The dog was fanning itself with a tattered palm-leaf fan and said, \"I had planned to learn some mortal skills in the human world. Who would have thought that in this world, great talent brings such peril!\"\r\n\r\nWith that, the dog snapped the fan, and disappeared.",

There is nothing to worry about.\"\r\n\r\nThe young monk, munching on both halves of the watermelon, said noncommittally, \"That thing tests the bearer's heart greatly. He has borne it alone for many years, let's hope he doesn't fail at the last moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe strange man quickly responded, \"That's why, if this time that monkey succeeds, wouldn't it be the best of both of you?\"\r\n\r\nThe young monk stopped, looked up at the strange man, who quickly bowed his head and apologized.\r\n\r\nThe young monk laughed again, waved his hand, and said, \"Go, go.

But remember this: the Lady of Mount Tai oversees all foxes and despises those who seduce and consume humans. You must know that absorbing human essence is the quickest way for yaoguais to become powerful.
